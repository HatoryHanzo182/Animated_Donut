This code implements a spinning donut pseudo animation and displays it in the console using ASCII characters. The donut animation concept and basic mathematical principles are based on the work of Andy Sloan, which can be found at [a1k0n.net](https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math). .html).

### Mathematical basis

The donut animation is created using a mathematical technique known as ray tracing. contains a detailed explanation of the mathematics of donut animation, including the trigonometric functions, coordinates, and transformations used to calculate the position and depth of donut points.

### How it works

The code uses a combination of nested loops and arrays to generate character values and display depth for each donut point. It calculates the coordinates and depths of points based on the mathematical formulas described in the article. It then maps the depth values to ASCII characters and stores them in an array. Finally, it prints an array of characters to the console, giving the illusion of a spinning donut.

### Beginning

To run the code, do the following:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the code with a C++ compiler that supports the required libraries.
3. Run the compiled executable.

### Result

The code generates a mesmerizing animation of a spinning donut in the console. The donut seems to have depth and perspective due to the clever use of ASCII characters to represent dots. This creates an optical illusion that is both intriguing and visually appealing.
